You are given an array and you need to find number of tripets of indices (i, j, k) such that the elements at those indices are in geometric progression for a given common ratio r and i < j < k.

For example, arr = [1, 4, 16, 64]. If r = 4, we have [1, 4, 16] and [4, 16, 64] at indices (0, 1, 2) and (1, 2, 3).

### Function Description

Complete the countTriplets function in the editor below. It should return the number of triplets forming a geometric progression for a given r as an integer.

countTriplets has the following parameter(s):

arr: an array of integers
r: an integer, the common ratio
