Consider an array of integers,arr = arr[0], arr[1],...arr[n-1]. We define the absolute difference between two elements, a[i]  and a[j] (where i != j), to be the absolute value of a[i] - a[j].

Given an array of integers, find and print the minimum absolute difference between any two elements in the array. For example, given the array arr = [-2, 2, 4] we can create 3 pairs of numbers: [-2, 2], [-2, 4] and [2, 4]. The absolute differences for these pairs are 4, 6 and 2, respectively. The minimum absolute difference is 2.
